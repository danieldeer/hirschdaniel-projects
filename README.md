### Compiling
To compile SDL Projects, append the compilation flags (as shown in the videos):
`sdl2-config --cflags --libs`

To compile Win API projects, I use mingw32-gcc. If it's a graphics project in Windows API, you need to append
`-lgdi32`
as a compiler flag.

### Support
Many thanks to you! You are keeping the channel alive and create an unproportionally large impact!

### Contact
You should be able to reach out to me directly via Patreon in case you are missing any project!

### Contribute
Feel free to create pull requests and contribute improvements. Although I'd like to keep the project code as similar to YouTube as possible, to keep the barrier of entry as low as possible.
